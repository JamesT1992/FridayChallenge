# FridayChallenge

# What was the Challenge?
The challenge was to create a script.sh file and run through a series of commands, as well as creating a git repository and a second script if possible as a bonus challenge.
# How I expected the challenge to go?
I had a good understanding of the content for the majority of the week, the only thing I felt I didn't fully grasp was the concept of scripts. Which as above was sadly rather instrumental for the success of this week's challenge.
# What went well?
My working knowledge of the linux bash terminal is good, as well as my ability to successfully navigate the terminal both for both everyday usage and for git. During the challenge I looked at my notes and the QA website to help with remembering the commands. Although I wasnt very confident with my initial capability of running scrips, I believe my effort was respectable in the sense that I got a large bulk of the script working, there were a few technicalities that I struggled with.
# What didnt go as planned?
Trying to execute the file as a different user was not working as planned, I tried various commands such as chgrp and chown to try and change the ownership of the file to then be able to switch into the new user that I created to execute my RUN.SH file, but at the time of writing this, still had no success in making it work. It was largly a permission error, so I tried again with the sudo prefix but still having no real success. I feel like I made it 90-95% of the way to completing it, so am intrigued to find out where I went wrong.
# Possible improvements for future challenges?
I appreciate that Ben and the team have a limited window in which to deliver a large amount of content, however, as a group we only had approxiamtely 2 hours on scripts on the thursday prior to the challenge on the friday. I don't think this was quite enough time for me to fully understand how to successfully write a script, and this is where I feel I've just gone wrong and not quite managed to finish it. To summarise, looking back, having completed the first week, and now undertaking the challenge, i think scripts were ultimately the end goal of the week and should have been given a little more time to be covered, especially as they were such an instrumental part of the weekly challenge.
